People in the court watching the match logs into the app and choose a side: one side will represent the player who draws the ball and the other side will be the one that receives. Players must choose the side that the ball will be thrown / received by swiping an area on the device. Then they will shake the device to send the vote!\r\n\r\nTo run the application, just run node server/server.js and access the different html files:\r\n\r\n      · inputTeam.html: device controller for teams\r\n      \r\n      · scoreboard.html: the scoreboard that can be showed up in a big, big screen!\r\n\r\n      · controlPanel.html: a simple control panel to reset the scoreboard and then start again.\r\n\r\n# Scaffolding\r\n\r\n/server - this is where the server.js is located and must be runned on your server to play the app\r\n\r\n/public\r\n      \r\n      /js           - javascripts files to control the views (html files)\r\n      \r\n      /stylesheets  - css files to give the views some good style\r\n      \r\n      /images       - autodescriptive.\r\n  \r\n      /sounds       - used by the app (we're insane, right?)\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
